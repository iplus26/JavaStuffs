# OVERVIEW

Here is some simple works I made for my Java class, including a music player (Mp3Player), a midi player (Midi), a image modifier (Pci), a image compressor (Smaller), a graphic game and a clock (MyClock).

## MUSIC PLAYER (Mp3Player)

The music player implements play, pause, stop and switch to the next song, using [JID3](https://blinkenlights.org/jid3/) and [JLayer](http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html) libs.

## MIDI PLAYER (Midi)

The midi player implements a piano on your computer. Play it using your keyboard or mouse. It's really not so good, considering I am really bad at the music and instruments. It uses [JFugue](http://www.jfugue.org) lib.

## IMAGE MODIFIER (Pci)

The image modifier, which I named *Pci*, could be used to add some effects to the image. The effects are like:

## IMAGE COMPRESSOR (Smaller)

I am now working on it, using [Class DCT](http://www.nyx.net/~smanley/dct/DCT.html) by [Stephen Manley](http://www.nyx.net/~smanley/).

## GAME (Hold60s)

The Hold60s is a simple graphic game. Use **w, a, s, d** to control the big circle, which represents yourself, to avoid the small circles drop from the top.

## CLOCK (MyClock)

A really simple java clock, writing in the beginning of my java learning trip. Forget the user interface and focus on my sincerity.
