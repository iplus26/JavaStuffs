# OVERVIEW

Here is some simple works I made for my Java class, including a music player (Mp3Player), a midi player (Midi), a image modifier (Pci), a image compressor (Smaller) and a clock (MyClock).

## MUSIC PLAYER (Mp3Player)

The music player implements play, pause, stop and switch to the next song, using JID3 and JLayer libs.

## MIDI PLAYER (Midi)

The midi player implements a piano on your computer. It's really not so good, considering I am really bad at the music and instruments.

## IMAGE MODIFIER (Pci)

The image modifier, which I named *Pci*, could be used to add some effects to the image. The effects are like:

## IMAGE COMPRESSOR (Smaller)

I am now working on it, using a DCT class by Stephen Manley, UCCB. Hope to solve it in today.

## CLOCK (MyClock)

A really simple java clock, writing in the beginning of my java learning trip. Forget the user interface and focus on my sincerity.
